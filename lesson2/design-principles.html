        <li>Company Website: apple.Inc</li>
        <li>Website Link: <a href="https://www.apple.com">apple.com</a></li>
        <li><p>Apple's website is one of the cleanest and well layed out websites out there in my opinion. They keep the design very simple so it's easy to navigate and satisfying for the eyes.</p></li>

        <li>Company Website: K2 SNOW</li>
        <li>Website Link: <a href="https://k2snow.com">k2snow.com</a></li>
        <li><p>K2's website shows good visual hiarchy, it has a clean simple design that guides your eyes to whats important on the website. THey don't make it too colorful so it's not super distracting, your eyes will probably wonder to the main picture first which is of their new line of skis, which is the most important link availabe, then you may wonder to the K2 Logo and then to the "stacked pancake" menu to browse more.</p></li>

        <li>Company Website: The North Face</li>
        <li>Website Link: <a href="https://www.thenorthface.com">thenorthface.com</a></li>
        <li><p>The North Face Website uses the rule of thirds, you can see that nothing is exactly centered in the layout and that it creates a different look than the other 2 websites that I posted above. For example the logo you can see is in the upper lefthand corner while the people are in the middle righthand area. </p></li>
